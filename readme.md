This is part of my idea for an app focused on financial information. It gives insight into the number of outstanding shares of a company traded on the US Stock Market.

Problem: There are times that the number of outstanding shares is not updated for example on Google or other platforms with respect to the latest filing 8K, 10Q, or 10K.

This function navigates through these SEC filings to look for the latest warrants issued or stock purchases by the company and ignore irrelevant information.

The data is gathered through the SEC EDGAR API.

This idea is not a financial advice.
